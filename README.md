# Political-Compass-Python

This Python script implements a Political Compass Quiz that helps users visualize their political leanings on a two-dimensional graph. The quiz covers economic (left/right) and social (authoritarian/libertarian) perspectives.
# Features:

Interactive questionnaire with 20 weighted questions
Questions cover left/right economic views and liberal/non-liberal social views
Calculates scores based on user responses and question priorities
Generates a visual political compass using matplotlib
Plots the user's position on the compass
Provides a breakdown of individual scores for each category

# How it works:

Users answer a series of yes/no questions on various political topics
Each question has an assigned priority (weight)
The script calculates scores for left, right, liberal, and non-liberal categories
These scores are used to determine the user's position on the political compass
The resulting graph shows the user's position in one of four quadrants:

Authoritarian Left
Authoritarian Right
Libertarian Left
Libertarian Right



# Requirements:

Python 3.x
matplotlib library

# Usage:
Run the script and follow the prompts to answer the questions. After completing the quiz, a political compass graph will be displayed, showing your position based on your responses.
This project is ideal for those interested in political science, data visualization, or anyone curious about their own political leanings. Feel free to customize the questions or adjust the visualization to suit your needs!
